    abstract = {3D generative modeling is accelerating as the technology allowing the capture of geometric data is developing. However, the acquired data is often inconsistent, resulting in unregistered meshes or point clouds. Many generative learning algorithms require correspondence between each point when comparing the predicted shape and the target shape. We propose an architecture able to cope with different parameterizations, even during the training phase. In particular, our loss function is built upon a kernel-based metric over a representation of meshes using geometric measures such as currents and varifolds. The latter allows to implement an efficient dissimilarity measure with many desirable properties such as robustness to resampling of the mesh or point cloud. We demonstrate the efficiency and resilience of our model with a generative learning task of human faces.},

abstract="Modelling randomness in shape data, for example, the evolution of shapes of organisms in biology, requires stochastic models of shapes. This paper presents a new stochastic shape model based on a description of shapes as functions in a Sobolev space. Using an explicit orthonormal basis as a reference frame for the noise, the model is independent of the parameterisation of the mesh. We define the stochastic model, explore its properties, and illustrate examples of stochastic shape evolutions using the resulting numerical framework.",
