Freshly graduated from [CRIStAL](https://www.cristal.univ-lille.fr/?rubrique9) at the University of Lille, in France. I am working on developping algorithms and new
methods for 3D/4D deformation models of non-rigid shapes. My work was supervised by Prof. Mohamed Daoudi (IMT Nord-Europe) and 
Sylvain Arguillère (Laboratoire Painlevé, CNRS).

I am currently enrolled as a Postdoc at the University of Copenhagen, in the [Pioneer Centre for AI](https://www.aicentre.dk/people).
